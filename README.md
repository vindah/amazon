# planet-api
An API test using cypress(mocha and javascript) to perform a POST request for "https://www.amazon.in/"

# Framework Used
I have used the cypress framework, which is a good tool for api testing and also packages MOCHA & CHAI by default, written in javascript, as these are the preferred recommended for set up

Mocha framework was used in the integration/get-planet.spec.js for describing and dividing the testcases. And Chai was used for assertions

# How to set up
- First thing you should do it pull the project
- Navigate to folder on terminal and '**npm install**'
- To run cypress, on terminal type '**node_module/.bin/cypress open**' or '**npx cypress open**'
- Select the API test file
- RUN TEST!

# Tour
Fixtures folder -> For test data

Integration -> For main test file

cypress.json -> Adjust configuration and add **base url**
